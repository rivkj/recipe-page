This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Within this project, I created a page for all the recipes I use that work for me and have been tweaked for personal use. There are many sites and books that display recipes but not all work or are lacking, therefore I compiled a list of recipes that I have tried, are true and have persisted in my own kitchen. Credits will be linked to the accounts where they came from, if no links are listed, they are personal.

### Page after styling was added:

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
